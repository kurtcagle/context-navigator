<!-- Always decorate your custom element template tag with a class, preferably
  matching the name of your custom element. This will allow you to write
  robust css that plays well with the as-element attribute, e.g. <form as-element="modal">. -->
<template class="modal ${visible ? 'visible' : ''}">


  <!-- I want my modal to have a "greyed out" background, so I need to have a 
    box in my modal that will contain the modal dialog box content. -->
  <div class="modal-content">

    <!-- I also might want to add an optional header element. Since I want it
      to be optional, I will probably be using the ":empty" selector, so I need
      to make sure there is no whitespace in the element. I give it a slot and
      call the slot "header". -->
    <div class="modal-header"><slot name="header"></slot></div>

    <!-- Next I have the main body of the modal. It contains the default slot. -->
    <div class="modal-body">
      <slot></slot>
    </div>

    <!-- Finally, I want to include an optional footer element. Every modal
      should probably have this footer element, but almost every modal is going
      to have the same content in the footer, so I add an optional slot "footer"
      with default content. The default action will be to close the modal. -->
    <!--<div class="modal-footer">
      <slot name="footer">
        <button click.delegate="close()">Close</button>
